The aspect of the real world that I would like to model is that of food and cooking. Personally, I am lazy when it comes to cooking and in hopes of me actually doing some cooking I want to develop an application which removes the thought needed to be put into the cooking process, such as thinking about what to cook, what groceries to buy, etc. I want this app to "choose" what I'm going to be cooking for the day, display the food, the ingredients, and directions how to make it. Now this relates to this database project because I would like to store this data into a database so in the future I can store different kinds of food, ingredients, recipes, and potentially add more stuff, such as a diet for healthy eating, muscle building, fat burning, etc. This would be a really helpful application for me because it would allow me to one, eat good food everyday, and two it could potentially be helpful to other people who are in the same situation as me (lazy college kids). The data requirements would include food, recipes, ingredients, food plan, type of food (such as Italian or Indian food), meal, drinks, etc. The types of applications that need to be supported would be loads, retrievals, and reports.
